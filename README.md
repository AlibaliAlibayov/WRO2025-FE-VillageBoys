## Introduction


 This engineering documentation offers a comprehensive overview of the **Village Boys Team's** self-driving robot, developed and programmed by our team from the Philippines for the **Future Engineers Category at the WRO Azerbaijan 2025 Local Finals**. Within this document, you'll find insights into the robot’s design, functionality, and features — all reflecting our dedication to advancing autonomous technology.

 The documentation highlights key aspects of the robot’s development, including:

 * **Mobility Management** – covering motor selection, chassis design, and assembly, all guided by principles of speed, torque, and power;
 * **Power and Sense Management** – detailing the power sources and sensor setup, supported by a wiring diagram and a full Bill of Materials (BOM);
 * **Obstacle Management** – outlining our navigation strategies through flow diagrams and code breakdowns.

 To complement the technical information, we've included visual documentation such as real and 3D model images of the robot from multiple angles, along with team photos. Additionally, performance videos showcase the robot in action across various challenge scenarios.


## The Team

 Our team consists of three dedicated members, each bringing unique strengths and expertise to the table. As the _Village Boys Team_, our primary goal is to work with maximum efficiency while combining our individual skills to learn from one another and grow together. Through close collaboration, we aim not only to enhance our personal knowledge in robotics, AI, and embedded systems, but also to continuously improve the performance, intelligence, and reliability of our robot — _Hoqqa_. We believe that teamwork, curiosity, and perseverance are the key drivers behind our success in building a competitive and innovative autonomous vehicle.

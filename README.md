Village Boys – Azerbaijan
====

This repository presents the **Village Boys Team**'s self-driving car — **Hoqqa**, developed and programmed by our team from Azerbaijan for the **World Robot Olympiad™ 2025 – Future Engineers Category (Self-Driving Cars)**, under the theme *The Future of Robots*. Here, you'll find comprehensive details about our robot’s design, architecture, and features — a result of our team's commitment to pushing the boundaries of autonomous technologies and innovative robotics.

### 3.1 Hoqqa Car‚Äôs Logic

The Hoqqa system is built on **ROS 2**, which manages sensor integration, data processing, and control. At startup, the program initializes the **LIDAR**, the **Nuwa 60C-HP depth camera**, and variables for lap tracking and timing, before entering a continuous loop.

The LIDAR provides distance measurements to keep a safe margin from walls, while the depth camera supports lap counting and reference-point recognition on the circuit. Sensor data is continuously analyzed to adjust speed and steering, ensuring stable navigation.

During the Obstacle Challenge, the depth camera detects block colors to decide maneuvering:

* **Red** ‚Üí pass on the right
* **Green** ‚Üí pass on the left

At the same time, LIDAR maintains wall awareness for safe evasion. After completing the required laps and obstacle avoidance, Hoqqa searches for a suitable parking space and performs a parallel parking maneuver using distance and angle calculations from its sensors.


### 3.2 Why Python?

For the Hoqqa project, **Python** was chosen as the main programming language because it provides the perfect balance between flexibility, speed of development, and hardware control. Since our system relies on both real-time sensor data and complex decision-making, Python allows us to rapidly develop and refine algorithms while keeping the code clean and easy to maintain.

We benefit from Python in several ways:

* **Readable and efficient** ‚Üí Python‚Äôs high-level syntax makes it easy to write, test, and debug, which is essential for rapid prototyping and adapting strategies during WRO preparation.
* **Extensive libraries** ‚Üí From **ROS 2 integration**, computer vision, and AI tools to low-level hardware control on the Raspberry Pi, Python offers ready-to-use libraries that accelerate development.
* **Cross-platform use** ‚Üí Python runs seamlessly on the Raspberry Pi, making it the ideal choice for tasks such as motor control, depth camera processing, and LIDAR data handling.
* **Flexibility in logic** ‚Üí Advanced navigation, obstacle avoidance, and sensor fusion are easier to implement and adjust thanks to Python‚Äôs dynamic nature and strong support in the robotics community.

By combining these advantages, Python allows us to move quickly from simulation to real-world testing, making it the backbone of Hoqqa‚Äôs control system.

### 3.3 Why ROS 2?

For Hoqqa, we rely on **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)** as the backbone of our software. ROS 2 is an open-source robotics framework that provides modular tools for sensor integration, navigation, and simulation. It has become a standard in robotics because it enables complex systems to be built in a flexible and scalable way.

We use ROS 2 for the following reasons:

* **Sensor and Actuator Integration** ‚Üí ROS 2 allows us to connect the **Nuwa 60C-HP depth camera**, LIDAR, and motor controllers into a single coordinated system. Each sensor publishes data as topics, making it easy to synchronize perception and control.
* **Environmental Perception with LIDAR** ‚Üí Using ROS 2 drivers and mapping packages, we process 360¬∞ distance data to detect obstacles and track walls. This real-time perception is essential for navigating the WRO track.
* **Autonomous Navigation and Path Planning** ‚Üí With ROS 2 navigation tools, we combine depth camera and LIDAR data for decision-making. This enables dynamic path planning, especially during the **Obstacle Challenge**, where the car must react quickly to red or green blocks.
* **Simulation and Debugging** ‚Üí ROS 2 integrates with **Gazebo** for simulation and **RViz** for real-time visualization. This allows us to test algorithms safely in a virtual environment before deploying them on the real car, reducing risk and speeding up development.

ROS 2 gives us a solid foundation to bridge simulation and real-world performance, making it an essential part of the Hoqqa project.

## 4. Mobility Management

Mobility is the core element of the Hoqqa project, as the car must navigate efficiently, adapt to track conditions, and complete tasks with stability. To achieve this, the chassis and key components were designed in **3D modeling software** and printed using **PLA**, a material that is lightweight, durable, and cost-effective. PLA provides enough strength for stability while keeping the vehicle light, which is ideal since our design does not aim for extreme speeds but rather for precise and reliable control.

The overall shape of Hoqqa is inspired by **formula-style cars**, with a low ground clearance that improves **road-holding** and reduces **aerodynamic drag**. This streamlined design helps the robot remain stable in turns and minimizes air resistance during movement.

An important design constraint was the placement of the **LIDAR sensor**. Since the competition walls are only 10 cm high, the LIDAR had to be positioned under this limit to ensure accurate scanning of the environment. Careful adjustment of its mounting allows Hoqqa to detect walls and obstacles reliably while still fitting within the official size requirements.

Finally, the **electronic components**‚Äîincluding motors, motor drivers, and sensors‚Äîwere chosen specifically to maximize mobility. They provide enough torque and responsiveness for smooth navigation, enabling Hoqqa to combine precise control with efficient obstacle avoidance.

### 4.2. Motor Axle System

Hoqqa uses a single **12V 7.5‚ÄØkg¬∑cm, 170‚ÄØRPM encoder motor** connected to a **26-tooth metal gear** that drives the rear axle. This configuration allows the rear wheels to efficiently support the weight of the car while providing smooth forward and backward movement. The gear ratio ensures better torque and control, improving stability during turns and reducing wear on the wheels. This design is especially important for maintaining precision and reliability on tight corners and variable track conditions.

    <img src="assets/3d-printing.jpeg" alt="Alibali" width="100%"/>
  </p>

## 7. Principal Strategy

### 7.1. PID Controller

A PID controller regulates a system by continuously comparing the desired target value (setpoint) with the current measured value and making adjustments based on three components:

* **Proportional (P):** Responds proportionally to the current error, providing an immediate correction.
* **Integral (I):** Accounts for accumulated past errors, helping to eliminate steady-state deviations.
* **Derivative (D):** Considers the rate at which the error is changing, smoothing the response and reducing overshoot.

By combining these three actions, a PID controller ensures the system reaches the desired target efficiently, maintaining stability and minimizing oscillations or delays.
